# Terminal Crate (`boxxy-terminal`)

## Responsibility
Manages the terminal environment, including split-pane layouts, PTY integration, and the Boxxy-Claw agent UI. It wraps the headless `boxxy-vte` widget and provides high-level terminal features.

## Architecture
The crate uses a deeply modular structure to manage the complexity of terminal panes:

### `TerminalPaneComponent` (`pane/` module)
The leaf component representing a single terminal instance. Modularized into:
- **`pane/mod.rs`**: Main component entry and public API. Handles configuration updates and state synchronization (e.g. inactive pane dimming).
- **`pane/ui.rs`**: Core widget initialization using `gtk::Overlay`, `gtk::ScrolledWindow`, and the `SearchBarComponent`.
- **`pane/gestures.rs`**: Input handling, including middle-click paste, focus tracking, and context menu wiring. Right-click ownership logic lives entirely in `boxxy-vte`; this file registers a callback via `terminal.on_context_menu(...)` to receive the event only when the terminal (not the running app) owns the click.
- **`pane/events.rs`**: VTE signal wiring and PTY event routing.
- **`pane/claw.rs`**: Integration with the `boxxy-claw` actor model. Manages in-terminal popovers, status indicators, and handles structured `ToolResult` events for rendering a read-only debug log in the sidebar.
- **`pane/preview.rs`**: OSC 8 hyperlink media previews (hover/click detection).

### `TerminalComponent` (`component.rs`)
The container component representing a single Tab. 
- It uses a `gtk::Overlay` as its root widget to layer a `gtk::Picture` (for tab-wide background images) underneath a `gtk::Stack` (containing the split-pane tree).
- Manages the recursive split-pane tree (`gtk::Paned`). Handles focus navigation, pane spawning, and maximization logic.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Splits**: Supports infinite vertical and horizontal terminal splits.
- **MsgBar Input**: Uses `boxxy_msgbar::MsgBarComponent` triggered by `Ctrl+/` to provide an inline, native GTK input directly over the active terminal cursor. This is the primary method for sending queries securely to the agent, providing rich autocompletion.
- **Seamless Background Images**: A single background image spans the entire tab seamlessly across all transparent terminal splits. 
- **Agent Integration**: Seamlessly routes terminal context (CWD, snapshots) and real-time foreground process changes (via D-Bus signals) to the Claw agent. Explicitly manages tracking lifecycle to ensure zero overhead when Claw is disabled.
- **Modern Hyperlinks**: Native OSC 8 support with robust media previews.
- **OSD Indicators**: Interactive overlays for terminal size and agent status.
