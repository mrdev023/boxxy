# Claw Crate (`boxxy-claw`)

## Responsibility
Provides the agentic reasoning engine for Boxxy-Terminal. It bridges the gap between terminal snapshots and host-level system administration by leveraging LLMs, specialized tools, and a highly scalable multi-agent architecture.

## Architecture
The crate uses an **Actor Model** mixed with a **Shared-Everything State** strategy to ensure state isolation while enabling workspace orchestration:

- **`engine/session.rs`**: Implements the `ClawSession` actor. Each terminal pane owns its own dedicated session loop.
- **`engine/agent.rs`**: Wraps the `rig-core` framework to create model-specific agents with tool support.
- **`engine/dispatcher.rs`**: Modular parser that cleans LLM output and decides how to route suggestions back to the UI.
- **`engine/context.rs`**: Assembles the agent's context by merging terminal snapshots, memories, and the Workspace Radar.
- **`engine/tools/`**: Contains Boxxy-specific tools like `SysShellTool`, `TerminalCommandTool`, `ActivateSkillTool`, and global orchestration tools (`ReadPaneTool`, `SetGlobalIntentTool`). Standard host tools (file, system, web, clipboard) are now delegated to the external `boxxy-core-toolbox` crate, which `boxxy-claw` configures and connects to its UI.
- **`registry/`**: Houses the global singletons that share data across all `ClawSession` actors efficiently without blocking.
  - **`skills.rs`**: Manages the `SkillRegistry`, using an `Arc<RwLock>` and `notify` to hot-reload `SKILL.md` files instantly across all panes. Fails gracefully with a warning if system inotify limits are reached.
  - **`workspace.rs`**: Manages the `WorkspaceRegistry`, acting as the **Global Radar** that tracks all active agents across the entire application for system-wide orchestration.
- **`memories/`**: Manages interactions with `boxxy_db`, including the **Background Observer** for implicit fact extraction.

## Key Features
- **Structured Semantic Context**: By leveraging the `boxxy-vte` engine's OSC 133 semantic prompt tracking, the Claw session receives a highly structured, markdown-formatted history of the terminal buffer (e.g., `[PROMPT]`, `[COMMAND]`, `[OUTPUT]`). This prevents the AI from hallucinating boundaries and dramatically improves the accuracy of error diagnosis and command suggestions.
- **Structured Data & Table Views**: The engine supports `ToolResult` events that allow tools to return JSON data. The UI thread intercepts these events to render rich read-only components (like a **Process List Table**) directly in the sidebar history, moving beyond raw text blocks.
- **Deep Reasoning Headroom**: The engine allows for up to **100 tool-calling turns** per interaction, providing sufficient space for complex, multi-step diagnostic and repair workflows without hitting "max turn" limits.
- **Dynamic Scrollback Paging**: The AI is not limited to the bottom of the screen. It can autonomously pull older context from the terminal's history using the `ReadScrollbackTool`, enabling it to diagnose errors that occurred hundreds of lines ago without passing the entire scrollback buffer to the LLM on every turn.
- **Global Orchestration ("Red Pony" Protocol)**: Conversations are isolated per terminal pane (`ClawSession`) but coordinated via a **Global Workspace Radar**. Agents are aware of ALL active peers across the application, regardless of their current working directory. They can explicitly coordinate using a "Manager Pattern" via `read_pane_buffer(agent_name)`, `list_active_agents()`, and `delegate_task(agent_name)`.
- **TUI Modality Awareness**: By monitoring real-time D-Bus signals from the host agent, Claw detects when a terminal enters an interactive TUI (e.g., `vim`, `python`). It automatically injects strict warnings into the system prompt and enforces the use of raw keystroke tools (`send_keystrokes_to_pane`) over standard bash commands to prevent incorrect scripting of interactive states.
- **Global Intent Blackboard**: Replaces directory-scoped intents with a single, system-wide scratchpad. Agents can broadcast high-level goals via `set_global_intent`, ensuring alignment across the entire PC.
- **Pane Lifecycle & TUI Control**: Agents possess native `spawn_agent`, `close_agent`, and `send_keystrokes_to_pane` tools. This empowers them to autonomously alter the terminal layout (splits/tabs), coordinate dev-environment setups, and even control interactive TUI applications (like `vim` or `htop`) in peer panes by injecting raw escapes and control sequences.

- **Visual Identity System**: Every agent is visually represented by a color-coded top-right badge in its pane. This badge is dynamically colored based on the agent's name hash and automatically hides in "Alternate Screen" modes to ensure zero obstruction during full-screen CLI tool usage. Residents can toggle this feature in the Advanced Settings. The badge also supports an **Evicted State** (grayscale) if its session is resumed elsewhere.
- **Provider-Agnostic Scaling**: The reasoning engine is decouple from specific AI providers. It uses the `AiCredentials` mapping and a modular `create_claw_agent` factory, allowing for seamless integration of new LLMs without architectural changes.
- **Session Resumption & Eviction**: Supports resuming the last 10 active sessions (>= 1 interaction) via `/resume`. Implements an **Eviction Model** where resuming a session in a new pane automatically deactivates the agent in the old pane to ensure state consistency.
- **Atomic Turn Saving**: Persists the entire message history and metadata to `boxxy_db` at the end of every turn, ensuring zero data loss and enabling reliable resumption.
- **Tiered Skill Injection & Compact Toolbox**: To save tokens, only the top-relevant skill is injected fully into the prompt. All other skills are listed compactly (name + 1-sentence description) in the "Toolbox". The agent can dynamically pull full instructions on-demand using the `activate_skill` tool.
- **FTS5 Semantic Search**: Built on top of a highly optimized SQLite FTS5 engine, enabling lightning-fast semantic retrieval for both memories and skills.
- **Host Privileged Operations**: Delegates administrative tasks (e.g., writing files, checking services) to the `boxxy-agent` via IPC.
- **Hybrid Memory System**: Uses a SQLite database (`boxxy.db`) with an FTS5 Key-Value "Upsert" model to store long-term user preferences and learned facts. 
  - **Explicit Tool Enforcement**: The agent is strictly mandated to use the `memory_store` tool for direct user requests to remember information.
  - **Implicit Background Observer**: A specialized `memory_model` evaluates every turn asynchronously to extract permanent facts without interrupting the main conversation.
  - **In-Memory Agent Persistence**: Instead of recreating agents per turn, `ClawSession` maintains a single, long-lived `rig::Agent` instance. This preserves internal session states and allows for faster, incremental context updates.
  - **Context Hygiene 2.0 & "No Duplicated Data"**: Includes LLM-powered Semantic Query Expansion and aggressive **Context Stripping**. Buffer states are limited to 50 lines / 5,000 characters. Previous turns are aggressively pruned of all dynamic blocks (Skills, Radar, Memories), leaving ONLY the raw user query and assistant response in history to stop linear token growth. Raw terminal data is never persisted to the database; only concise episodic summaries are saved.

## Directives
- **Lazy Loading & Lifecycle**: BoxxyClaw follows a strict two-stage initialization to keep the terminal lightweight:
  1. **Identity Phase (`Initialize`):** When Claw mode is toggled ON for a specific pane, the session actor receives an `Initialize` message. It immediately generates a fresh agent name (e.g., "Capable Tragopan"), clears history, and announces its identity to the UI so badges can appear instantly.
  2. **Resource Phase:** Heavy background resources (SQLite Database, Skill Loading, RAG) MUST NOT be loaded until the first actual user request (e.g., `? hello`). This ensures simply toggling Claw mode "On" for a pane doesn't consume excessive memory or CPU until the agent is utilized.
