//! Abstract interface the claw drawer uses to talk to its host (the
//! thing that owns the shell / scrollback / focus target / agent channel).
//!
//! Today the only implementor is `pane::claw_host::PaneClawHost` over a
//! terminal pane. The trait exists to decouple the drawer's UI code from
//! terminal-specific types (`TerminalWidget`, `PaneInner`, `PaneOutput`,
//! `claw_sender`) so the drawer can move into `boxxy_claw_widget` later
//! without dragging those along.
//!
//! When this file moves into `crates/boxxy_claw_widget/`, only the module
//! path changes — the trait shape is stable.
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - `!Send`, `!Sync`. GTK widgets are single-threaded; a `Send` bound
//!   would be a lie and would force `Arc<Mutex<...>>` ceremony in
//!   impls. If a cross-thread variant is ever needed, add it as a
//!   superset trait (`ClawHostThreadSafe: ClawHost + Send + Sync`).
//! - Async methods return `Pin<Box<dyn Future + 'static>>` (not `+
//!   Send`). The event loop uses `glib::spawn_future_local` which runs
//!   local-thread futures.
